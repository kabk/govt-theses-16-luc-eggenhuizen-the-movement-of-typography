		<p>From the very first signs of writing to our contemporary digital era, typefaces and typography have been having a tight relationship with the evolution of tools and techniques. This is even more true today, where we can experience daily typography and type design on screens, a new “technique” or media that was not even existing 50 years ago. How was typography present in the streets of Amsterdam at that time? While nowadays screens and smart phones have been replacing “static” matters. The evolution of tools is not simply changing the way typography and type design are being experienced, it is also influencing the way they are being conceived. No matter where we are or what we are looking at, phones, TV’s, shops etc. the use of digital techniques to animate typography is becoming more part of our daily landscape. The fact we are dealing with more and more moving images in our society has lead to a significant change in typographic use. Typography could not stay in a “static” state, but had to adapt to the change of time in order to stay of signifigance.</br>
		The research question leading this thesis is the following : To what extend is the digital era redefining our conceptions of typography and type design? This thesis has been constructed into three chapters, analyzing the trajectory that typography and type design are taking. The first chapter “The historical mutation”, describes key moments in history where typography and type design has been showing any form of movements or dynamics, and this from the industrial revolution on. From the time where the Futurists were consciously constructing suggestive movement in their poetry, to the introduction of computers and the actual translation of movement into typography and type design. The second chapter “The classification of typography”, will examine the current state of theories trying to classify this development in typography, as well as the actual implementation and use of the “moving” typography. As an example, the possibility of choise within typefaces as an experience with type for both reader and user. Finally, the third chapter “Transforming typography, transforming image culture”, is questioning the status of this “moving” typography, asking whether it consits of an enrichment for our visual culture or if it functions solely as a decoration.</p>

</div>

<div id="1.1" class="text"> <!-- Chapter 1.1 -->
	<div class="thesis"> 
		<p>From the eightienth century on, typography and type design received a more prominent role within society, since the 

		<a><u>Industrial Revolution</u></a><span class="drop">1. The Industrial Revolution was the transition to new manufacturing processes in the period from about 1760 to sometime between 1820 and 1840.</span> 

		brought greater human equality leading to an increase of public education and literacy. More and more demand for print to distribute informations in all possible ways and needs, asked for more bold and outspoken type design and typography. Printers setting type by hand received fierce competition from the lithographic printers, whom could project an artwork directly into print, giving a dynamic impression from the artist’s hand. Contrary to printers which had to set type with cast letters, the lithograph could directly transfer an artwork to a poster. This artwork could contain handwritten lettering, which can be considered as the definition of dynamic typography since it contains inconsistancy between the same letters, this resulting in different styles of the same character.  At the same time, type foundries started to experiment with sand casting big and bold type. This resulting into the invention of fat faces (fig.1).</p>

		<div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.1-RobertThorneFatFace.jpg">
		<span class="image-text">fig.1. Robert Thorne, fat-face types, 1821. He is thought of to be the first designer of the fat-face type in 1803.</span></div>

		<p>Machine like type design achieved by the thickening of the serif to resemble the same thickness as the strokes, or slab-serifs as known now (fig.2).</p>

		<div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.1-vincentfigginsslabserif.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.2. Vicnent Figgins, two lines pica, Antique c.1815. It is believed to be the first slab serif font.</span></div>

		<p>More developments were to be made regarding type design, almost as if every possibility had to be experimental and type foundries continued their explorations in contrasts, modification of forms, proportions and adding all kinds of different ornaments. 
		Those examples are first illustrations of how the developments of techniques have been influencing the design of typography and typefaces.  By exploring many possibilities depending on their range of tools, they created typefaces which design was directly coming from the restrictions of the tools. At this stage, the ‘moving’ aspect of typography and type design was not literally to be found since the medium was still static (paper), but rather the effort was put into the research of the expressivity: new letter shapes allowing for more contrast and rythm. 
		A new step in the research of dynamic through type design appeared with the first typeface giving the illusion of 3D, developed by

		<a><u>Vincent Figgins</u></a><span class="drop">2. Vincent Figgins was a British punch-cutter and type-founder. Born in Peckham, England, 1766 — 1844.</span>

		in 1815 (fig.3).

		</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.1-vincentfigginsfivelinespica.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.3. Vicnent Figgins, Five lines Pica. The first 3D font ever to be made.</span></div>


		<p>This typeface became so popular that many typefaces with all kinds of shading or striping evolved from it. By creating the illusion of a 3D shape, the letter was suggesting more dynamics, standing more out on the paper. The font had a feeling of shading, giving a direction to where the typeface was pointing towards. 
		Looking back at the previous examples, it seems that many efforts were put into the innovation of lettershapes. Let’s think about a time where the only way of advertising was made through letters painted on signs or printed matters. With his new 3D typeface, Figgins was offering the possibility to stand out from the crowd. 
		As standing out from one another as well as the demand of bigger advertising were growing necessities, the process of casting big tall letters became more and more challenging to printers and foundries : molds were imperfect since the metal would not stay liquid enough to fill all cavities. An American printer, named <a><u>Darius Wells</u></a><span class="drop">3. Darius Wells was an American printer.</br> Born 1800 — 1875.
		</span>, started experimenting with hand-carved wooden types and later on invented a lateral router which allowed for the mass manufacturing of wooden type for display printing. This opened up new possibilities in terms of taller letters and condensing the design, this leading to the first condensed type designs (fig.4).</p>

		<div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.1-Hndbillforanexcursiontrain1876.png"><span class="image-text">fig.4. Handbill for an train excursion, 1876. In the top the example of condensed type is used.</span></div>

		<p>The letters created had an appearance of a tall structure, giving an impression of height. Because of its condensed quality, the letters suggested a certain importance and were demanding more antention on the page. Saving space for longer words on one line created the opportunity to go bigger with the font. The feeling of the font had an intense and almost demanding tone to it, as if it was obligatory to look at it, giving the sensation of raising the voice and yelling out the message. 
	</br>
		After the massive impact of the Industrial Revolution, where somewhat bombastic design was the tone of voice, the run on typefaces and printing techniques became more fine tuned, allowing artists to make more refined work. Subsequently, in Art Nouveau ( 1890 — 1910), typography and type design did not follow anymore a need for mass communication through texts. Typography and type design in Art Nouveau became addaptive to their surroundings: integrating into the work of the artist and following the same style throughout the type design (fig.5).</p>

		<div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.1-Delftsche-Slaolie-Toorop-1894.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.5. Jan Toorop, poster for Delftsche Slaolie 1894.</span></div>

		<p>Typefaces were not produced on a large scale, but specifically made for each particular work (fig.6).</p>

		<div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.1-vienna_secession_thirteenth_exhibition_poster.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.6. Koloman Moser, poster for the thirteenth Vienna Secession. </span></div>

		<p>The dynamics of the typography and the fonts were to be found in their ability to blend with the organical style practiced by Art Nouveau.	
	</br>
		To conclude from those examples, it is clear that many ways of developping dynamic through typography and type design have appeared in the context of the Industrial Revolution. However, not willing to produce yet a sense of movement, but more of an aesthetic through shapes, contrasts and rythm. However, in the early 20th century, The Futurists developped a whole new sense of creating movement. The system of movable type, developped in the early days by 

		<a><u>Johannes Gutenberg</u>,</a><span class="drop">4. Technical improvement on the movable type, invented by Gutenberg back in 1450.</span>

		 was considered by the Futurists as a simple fixed block of horizontal lines of texts, held in a boxed shape structure. According to them, this system was restricting possibilities and had to be broken down in order to let the typography move freely.</p>

		<p>In fact, the <a><u>Futurists</u></a><span class="drop">5. Futurism was an artistic and social movement that originated in Italy in the early 20th century.</span>

		had a completely different look upon typography than what had been made previously in History. They started to experiment with letting letters flow over a page expressing an abundance of movement rather than fixed paragraphs. <a><u>Giovanni Papini</u></a><span class="drop">6.

		A passage in the book of

		highlights how this publication was a break-through from historical ways of dealing with typography: “The June 1913 issue published Marinetti’s article calling for a typographic revolution against the classical tradition. Harmony was rejected as a design quality because it contradicted ‘the leaps and bursts of style running through the page’.” (fig.7)</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.2-lacerbafilippoMarinetti.jpeg"><span class="image-text">fig.7. The article that Filippo Marinetti wrote as a contribution to Lacerba, in which he calles for an typographic revolution.</span></div><p> 


		The typographic image changed from an orderly and harmonized craft into the expression of the disorganized minds of the poets, translated into a typographic poems. The poems depicted very heavy typography that was placed in a controlled chaos, creating a visual map of the poets intentions. The choice of typefaces were ranging from sans serif to serif fonts, from which the weights were taken in account. For the Futurists, writing and typography could potentially become an expressive visual form, that directly communicates through the linguistics, but carries a lot of definition in the placement and use of non linguistic expression (fig.8,9,10).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.2-marinetti.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.8.

Futuristic typographic poem of 1919 by Filippo Tommaso Marinetti.</span></div><p> 


		As the work of Marinetti was very outspoken and daring, the work of 

		<a><u>Guillaime Apollinaire</u></a><span class="drop">10. Guillaume Apollinaire was a French poet, playwright, short story writer, novelist, and art critic of Polish descent. Born in Rome, Italy, 1880 ­— 1918.</span>

		was more modest and refined in its typographic choices. Apollinaire was considered as one of the foremost poets in the early 20th century, as well as being an impassioned advocate of the Cubism (fig.11).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.2-Guillaume_Apollinaire_Calligramme.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.11. Salut monde (Hello World). Calligram about the Eiffel Tower by Guillaime Appolinaire, 1918.</span></div><p> 

		He is most known for his poetic calligrammes: a phrase or poem typographically structured into an image. The arrangement of letters and words were depicting the topic of the phrase or poem, creating a contextual image of the poem. His letters were placed in a very delicate manners, enhancing the dynamics within the poetic text itself. 
		It seems that the work on poerty became a whole new playground for artists, writers and designers. Indeed, the <a><u>Dada movement</u></a><span class="drop">11. Dada or Dadaism was an art movement of the European avant-garde in the early 20th century.</span> 

		developed sound poetry that was comparable to the work of Apollinaire. The Dada movement was more interested in the pure visual qualities of typography and deconstructed letters to be seen as a pure visual form (fig.12).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.2-Merz 2.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.12. Kurt Schwitters, a spread from Merz 11, 1924. Ads for Pelikan Tusche and inks.</span></div><p> 

		By using typography to note down the pure sounds, they took away the linguistic meaning from words. As an addition to their work, color was of an importance to build one more layer of dynamics. By using the full space of the page as well as different fonts but also colors and orientations, they managed to create highly dynamical compositions where the elements seem to literaly move on the page. 
		The function of typography had clearly changed and became a tool of visual expression. As typography integrated more with the visual aspect of the design, a more dynamic layout was achieved. Where the freedom was taken by the Futurists and the Dadaists, 

		<a><u>El Lissitzky</u></a><span class="drop">12. El Lissitzky was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. Born in Pochinok, 1890 — 1941.</span>

		was moving forward into a more structured approach to typography using basic shapes and elements of typography in his work (fig.13).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.2-russian300.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.13. El Lissitzky’s title page for Veshch No.3, 1921-1922.</span></div><p> 

		El Lissitzky’s ideas changed the course of graphic design. In fact, by using his background as an architect to construct his work as a graphic designer, he made use of grid systems in order to place infromation in different hierarchies. His works were based on a hidden construction of grid systems, with which he tried to achieve dynamic and exciting designs. 

		<a><u>De Stijl</u></a><span class="drop">13. De Stijl, Dutch for “The Style”, also known as neoplasticism, was a Dutch artistic movement founded in 1917 in Amsterdam.</span>

		was starting along side the Russian movements of 

		<a><u>Suprematism</u></a><span class="drop">14. Suprematism is an art movement, focused on basic geometric forms, such as circles, squares, lines, and rectangles, painted in a limited range of colors.</span> 

		and 

		<a><u>Constructivism</u></a><span class="drop">15. Constructivism was an artistic and architectural philosophy that originated in Russia beginning in 1919 and was a rejection of the idea of autonomous art.</span>

		, which had similar ideas about the typography and type design from the Dada movement.  
		Following movements such as the Russian avant-Garde as well as De Stijl continued elaborating on those already established guidelines: basic shapes, colors and letters combined into dynamic compositions (fig.14,15)</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.2-Theo_van_Doesburg_Design_for_a_poster.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.14.

El lissitzky was invited by Theo van Doesburg to design and edit a double issue of De Stijl.</span></div><p>
		However, a shift can be witnessed during the span of the two world wars where the focus seemed to have moved towards propaganda. The compositions created at that time are light years away from the somewhat free and open graphic experiments of the Futurists or the Dadaists. From the early 1920’s, compositions seemed to be condemned to their political context. The first attempts of moving typography were not to be present till well after the second world war, when the designer Saul Bass together with the movie industry did actually put movement into letters. </p>

		<p>The first obvious attempts to make typography really move has been implemented into the title sequences by the movie industry together with American graphic designer <a><u>Saul Bass</u></a><span class="drop">16.

Directed by Otto Preminger in 1955. Strung-out junkie deals with daily demoralizing drug addiction while crippled wife and card sharks continue to pull him down.</span>

		The title sequence contains simple line graphics which are accompanied by texts. These texts appear and dissapear from the screen, others slide into the frame to their final position. The use of different ways of animating the text into the screen manages to surprise the spectator since none of the moves are the same or contain the same textual image. The graphics appear and disappear together or replace the text, giving a notion of hierarchy. Here, the term ‘dynamic’ does not apply anymore since the typography is moving over time. Terms such as ‘Motion’ or ‘Kinetic’ are more appropriate to describe the characteristics of this title sequence. After this movie Saul Bass has been collaborating with more famous moviemakers such as

</span>

		In his title sequences, he believed that typography had to play a role within the title sequence, a role that would tease and evoke. In his sequences typography plays a more important role, prior to the start of the actual movie, displaying the creators, the cast etc. Not only that was happening in the sequences Saul Bass made, but also his work contained a short summary of the movie in such a way that the spectator’s curiosity would be triggered. The movements used to animate the typography ranged from sliding in and out of screen, coming out of objects and fading in and out again. Throughout the years, different techniques were used in the title sequences, ranging from cut-outs to tangible use of typography. By creating a short story of the movie, he was able to re-use certain elements from the movie and play typographically with it.

		In the intro sequence, a woman is bellydancing and playing with the typography in various dance moves. The dances are ranging from fast to slow, changing the typography with her body. In this case, it is not the typography itself that is moving but its appearance is altered by the dancing woman. On the other hand, in the title sequence Altered States, the letters composing the title are moving through each others, sliding from left to right and right to left, allowing for the shapes of the letters to intertwine momentarily.

		By slowly zooming out, the title is reveiled. Both examples of title sequences are forms of Kinetic Typography since the letters are moving over time. The developments in the movie industries were no the only ones actively trying to make typography more “dynamic” in temporal media. The computer scientists were also making progress in creating programs that would dynamize the typography.

With his TeX program, Knuth had in mind that anybody could make high quality books by using a minimal amount of effort, and to give the same results on any computer at any given time. The working method of METAFONT is to describe the pens path, rather than the outline of the letters.

	<div class="thesis">
		<p>Graphic design has come to a point where it is mastering the suggestive power of dynamics in printed matter, composing typography and image onto static sheets of paper. Since the introduction of digital media, a noticalble change is taking place. Typography and type design are both in a shift, ensuring the quality of print onto digital media. To keep track of all this, theorists try to come up with specifications for these new forms of typography. There are some forms that have settled in what defines them, such as Kinetic– and Motion typography. Both define the same effects. Because digital media changes compared to print media, the term of temporal and non-temporal started to separate typography into a term. The difference is significant, where non-temporal does not change over time and temporal does. Non-temporal media such as print have only one kind of simularity to temporal media, which is dynamic typography. 

		</br></br>TEMPORAL TYPOGRAPHY</br>
		Temporal typography changes or moves over time, and normally appears in screen–based media in particular title sequences, TV station identities, and advertising. Temporal letterforms have the ability to manifest themselves in both static and kinetic ways, as well as physical and digital ways. Therefore it can’t be assessed by the same functional factors of traditional typography: legibility and readability. 

		</br></br>KINETIC TYPOGRAPHY</br>
		Kinetic typography is moving within the container and not the surrounding. The text has to move itself to become kinetic. Kinetic typography can only manifistate itself when the text is in movement, the container or the carrier of the message does not comply to the movement of the typography such as billboards, car adverts etc. The typography can interact directly with its surroundings and/ or interact with itself. It is not able for the typography to transform, that would be classified as metamorphosis. In the title sequense <u>From Russia with love</u>, which was designed by Robert Brownjohn and directed by Terence Young, typography is interacting with its surrounding (fig.20).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.3-russialove.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.20. From Russia with Love, title sequence. An example of the implementation of typography with kinetic charateristics where the surroundings are interacting with the typography.</span></div><p>

		The typography itself is not changing, but is being changed by the interaction. As an example of inter–action by itself the title sequense of Altered States, directed by Ken Russell and designed by Richard Greenberg, clearly shows this form (fig.21).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.3-alteredstates.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.21. Altered States, title sequence. An example of the implementation of typography with kinetic charateristics where the typography is interacting with itself.</span></div><p>

		</br></br>FLUID TYPOGRAPHY</br>
		The artist <a><u>Eduardo Kac</u></a><span class="drop">31. Eduardo Kac is a contemporary American artist and professor of Art and Technology Studies at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Kac was born in 1962, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. http://www.ekac.org/
</span>

		(1962) produced a series of works called Holopoetry, which are halograms with poetry (fig.22).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.1-EduardoKacLimbo.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.22. The holo poem Limbo with three different view angles.</span></div><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.1-EduardoKacSouvenir.gif"></div><p>

		In her essay “Fluid Typography : Construction, Metamorphosis and Revelation”, <a><u>Barbara Brownie</u></a><span class="drop">32. Dr Barbara Brownie leads online postgraduate study for MA Graphic Design and MA Illustration, and is director of the professional doctorate programmes DFA (Doctor of Fine Art) and DDes (Doctor of Design), at the University of Hertfordshire. 
</span>

		quotes Eduardo Kac over a possible definition of fluid typography: Kac describes his works as containing “fluid signs”, or signs that alter over time, “therefore escaping the constancy of meaning a printed sign would have”. They are capable of metamorphoses between a word and an abstract shape, or between a word and a scene or object. This is text that does not have a fixed identity or a reliable, constant meaning. It is constantly in flux, presenting multiple identities over time.

		</br></br>DYNAMIC TYPOGRAPHY</br>
		Motion and kinetic typography are terms used wide spread to define all kinds of effects, this tho, is often miss interpreted. The problem however is that when motion and kinetic are used to describe the action, the single characteristic is “motion” of temporal typography. There are other effects such as distortion and transformation, which suit better the term dynamic typography (fig.23).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter1.3-BEER.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.23. The work of Komninos Zervos, where the letters are morphing into other letters producing new words. This form of typography is known as metamorphisis or Dynamic Typography.</span></div><p>

		Still this term is rather vague in its range of descriptions. Dynamic is described in both temporal and non–temporal forms, where the text is static but suggesting movement. 

		</br></br>RESPONSIVE TYPOGRAPHY</br>
		Responsive design for websites is a form that does not change over time, it is changed the moment the user needs it to change (fig.24).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.2-callfortypewebsiteshort.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.24. Call for Type, website. When scrolling the text changes, the viewer is changing the typography.</span></div><p>


		The idea of responsiveness within the website is to optimize the design for different screen formats, from computers, tablets to mobile phones. The text frame for the computer will be wider than that of a phone, in order to display the text accordingly. By setting breakpoints for the typography, the textbox will change according to the set width of a breakpoint. Responsive typography allows typography to be set in a flexible frame, words can jump to the next line, hence the term “responsive”. The responsiveness makes sure that the text will always be readable till certain limits, whenever the browser window is narrowed for instance. Designers can control the outcome of the appearance of the text more, giving the user an optimal reader experience digitally. This is compared to print a benifit for the digital format, since the container is not fixed. It allows the user to adjust the comfort of reading to its own needs.</p>

	<div class="thesis">
		<p>The computer has become a tool for type designers in the sense of the actual designing and adding more features to a font such as alternates. The designer can create more variations of a font in shorter time period, in which the computer allows to compare and put the font next to eachother for the designer to optimize the process. By making use of coding, the font can be told what to do when, what alternates to use and when these should be applied. The implementation of new features into the design of typefaces has lead to new exiting designs which can be small features or clearly visible features. The reader experiences another way of reading and for designers other options to choose from. These features are explored in printed matter as well as in the digital platform, ranging from literally changing the alternates to implementing them in plain texts and coming across them while reading. Maybe during the reading of this thesis this it came to realization that the text is actually containing contextual alternates, which are alternates that change whenever certain letters follow up after another: like in better and keep. The typeface used in this thesis has been designed by me personally for the purpose to illustrate the Dynamics, and to experience a different kind of typography and type design. (fig.25)

		</p>
		<div class="centered">
			<p style="line-height:52px;font-size:50px" color="rgb(248,248,248)">contextual alternates</br> used in this font:</br>aaa ccc eee f f f</br>ggg jjj rrr sss yyy</p>
		</div>
		<input type="checkbox" id="ligature-switch" value="1" checked><p>
		

		By using the contextual alternates, it is possible to create different appearances of the same letter. Resulting in a typeface that contains a dynamic property, this illustrates the flexibilty of the computer as a tool within digital and print.

		Another example with contextual alternates is the work of <a><u>Remco van Bladel</u></a><span class="drop">33. Remco van Bladel is a graphic designer,  based in Amsterdam.

		in 2015. This typeface is making use of different characters of the same letter, making miniscule differences within the same letter. The visual impact of the differences becomes an exploration within the text, allowing the reader to experience more than the written story. In fact the case of <u>Natura</u> is a conceptual based idea built up from the work of herman de vries, where nature and human nature have a close relationship (fig.26).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.2-natura-herman-specimen.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.26. The font Natura and its contextual alternates featured in this specimen. Designed by Remco van Bladel for the Dutch Pavilion of the Venice Biennale, 2015, which was featuring the work of the dutch artist herman de vries.</span></div><p>

		The idea behind the typeface was to take the geometric font <u>Futura</u> and adjust the typeface in a more organic but geometric letters. Differences in length of the ascenders/ descenders and changing the width of some letters give away it has been customized. 
		
		In contrary to print, the website for the exhibition <a><u>Call for Type</u></a><span class="drop">36. The contest «Open Call for Type», which was set up by the Gutenberg-Museum in Mainz and the Institut Designlabor Gutenberg, attracted enormous international interest: 290 type designs from more than 17 countries, ranging from «A» like Argentina to «U» like USA, could impressively show the status of up-to-date type design. http://callfortype.de/</span>

		in Meinz features another kind of reading experience achieved by alternates. The website’s text is changed by the reader scrolling down, whose action writes and erases information. Because the reader is in control of the movement, this phenomenon is not classified as kinetic but dynamic, here again time is not changing the typography. The contextual alternates are used on the same possition and when scrolled they replace themselves in a random order according to what is written (fig.27).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.2-callfortypefullwebsite.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.27 Call for Type, website.

		It seems there has been made a clear decision in hierarchy and where the animation is applied and where not. To keep a good legibility in the longer texts, there is no animation creating a calm text image. For the headers, it is less important to have good legibility since they are considerably bigger. In the font <u>Natura</u>, this effect is applied throughout all the text, however in this website, only the headers have the effect. The choice to only apply it to the headers seems to create enough of an effect, which works very nicely together with the content. Picture, having to read the whole webpage like that. And as it goes for Natura, it is not in continues motion, which does not harm the legibility of the font. 
		The work of <a><u>Radim Peško</u></a>,<span class="drop">38. Radim Peško who runs RP Digital Type Foundry is a small scale type foundry established in 2009.  http://www.radimpesko.com</span>

		is also often containing the possibility of choice. His practice in type design is somewhat more experimental and out of the ordinary compared to more traditional foundries. For example, some of his typefaces contain a variety of different designs within the same font, not designign a regular and a bold but two different styles of fonts. The possibility to choose different styles from the same font family is a different way of looking at type design compared to the traditional regular, bold and italic styles. Within the fonts <u>Boymans</u>, <u>Pomelo</u> and <u>LYNO</u> there is only different styles availible,  as the fonts do not express a weight or angle, but more a style with different characteristics. In the typeface <u>LYNO</u> which Radim designed together with <a><u>Karl Nawrot</u></a>,<span class="drop">39. Karl Nawrot is a French graphic designer based in Amsterdam. http://www.voidwreck.com/</span> 

		it was the aim as Radim Peško states on his own website: “The characters of Ulys(ses 31), Stan(ley Kubrick), Jean (Arp) and Walt (Disney) negotiate the digital freedoms of their production through playful typologies of form. They are open and various, and their spirit is this: to resist normative tendencies and to reject the idea of definitive form.” (fig.28)</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.2-LYNO.jpg"><span class="image-text">fig.28. The font LYNO containing four different styles which all have their iconic reference to famous people.</span></div><p>


		Such forms of alternates are adapted widely by type foundries, such as <a><u>Grilli Type</u></a>.<span class="drop">40. Grilli Type is an independent Swiss type foundry. https://grillitype.com/</span> In their font <u>GT Haptik</u>, which contains certain modesty in the alternates put into it, their type specimen clearly illustrates the effects of these alternates. (fig.29)</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.2-GT-Haptik-alternates"><span class="image-text">fig.29. The font GT Haptik, an extract from the type specimen by Grill Type. Displaying the alternates availible within the typeface.</span></div><p>

		Offering choice within a font gives the user the possibility to apply the font to different situations. By giving more choice from a type design level, the typography can adapt itself more without having to find a similar font to replace on another. This makes the font more multi functional and attractive, but can also be pure element of decoration and not necessarely a function. </p>

		has been based upon animation, not only typographically but also pictographically. The typography is dynamic since it does not change over time and the appearance changes because of the dots(fig.30).

		The dots covering the letters change the appearance of the logo in countless possibilities, making the identity highly dynamic but also a flexible identity. The identity can carry many different appearances and still be recognizable, but could possibly be also the weakness. As a big part of the visual is determined by the random appearance of the dots, there is a loss of control over the appearance of the visual. In the case of Sagmeister and Walsh, it seems to become more of a decorative feature than saying something about the identity. The relation to the purpose of the company and the visual is not visible.In contrary, the identity of the <a><u>mit media lab</u></a>,<span class="drop">44.

		actually makes perfect use of the flexibility of an identity to fulfill the needs. The grid applied in the logo became the basis for the letters within the grid system, for every department another playfull combination is made. By using a system to show every department of the school, different visuals with a purpose are made. The logos formed by the first letters of the words are possibly at the border of abstraction, creating a visual language of its own (fig.31). 

		By continuing to use the abstract typography generated into visuals there appears to be a visual aspect to the logo in a more abstract form. 
		The work of <a><u>Philippe Apeloig</u></a><span class="drop">45. Philippe Apeloig is a graphic designer based in Paris, France. http://apeloig.com/</span>

		goes a little further with animation, and creates animated videos acompanying a few of his works (fig.32). 

		His work seems to reverse the process of making, by first creating the video and after the actual work itself. His videos are compositions of typography, shapes, colors and implements these into a moving image. Some other animations he made are a deconstruction of typography and type design, by transforming the typographic elements from one shape into another. Some deconstructions of the type design come with different end results, but in terms of animation do not go further than just playing with the shapes and making them compose different images. And for that it raises the question if the animation is adding something more to the work than just an exploration of the possibilities of the work. The animation is a litteral translation of what the poster is suggesting, potentially leading to the deminishing of the suggestive power of the poster (fig.33).

		The works of <a><u>Felix Pfäffli</u></a><span class="drop">46. Studio Feixen is the graphic design work of Felix Pfäffli. Born in 1986. http://www.feixen.ch/
</span>

		have another approach to the use of animation, he made two works displayed on his website as posters which are meant to be presented in another way. The first poster is actually meant for the biggest LED screen in Shanghai, and the other is an experiment for the splash page of Wired magazine. But what also is happening, is that the work is questioning the purpose of the poster and the way it can be used for moving typography. Pfäffli’s work is an outstanding example of mastering typography as an image, and also is making use of motion in his work. The two posters he made are small videos of typographic experiment in motion, both of them within the kinetic typography. The poster of letters falling like blocks from the top has a somewhat Tetris approach to the work, a rahter straight forward animation (fig.34).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.3-Shanghai_Big_2-felixpfaffli.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.34. The falling letters for the Shanghai LED screen.</span></div><p> 

		This poster is a little more complex and playing with the illusionistic effect of a loop, turning the readable text into a more abstract play of lines and colours. This work is a little more complex animation and is in terms of graphics more exiting, not only giving a complex structure but also containing a message to be found (fig.35).</p><div class="images"><img src="image/chapter2.3-feixenwired.gif"><span class="image-text">fig.35. The endless rotating animation that weirdly intertwines with itself.</span></div><p> 

		The format and way this is presented is unmistakable to be a poster, mounted on a wall with holding clips pinned to the wall. The surprising effect of poster1 to learn it is a moving poster contains a nice element of surprise. For the other poster the complexity of the image is more appealing.
